A machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a loan should be approved using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Built using Streamlit and trained using scikit-learn.

## Features
- Takes applicant financial and personal details as input
- Uses k-NN model for binary classification (Approve / Reject)
- Simple UI built in Streamlit
- CSV training dataset included

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train model (optional):
   python train_model.py

3. Start web app:
   streamlit run app.py
